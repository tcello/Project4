    <p>The case is very different with the French planter and his Negroes.</p>
    <p>The perpetual servitude of his Negroes is not only consented to by that nation, but is expressly authorized by the king’s edict.</p>
    <p>There are no books to be given them to read which charge their masters with infringing both divine and human laws by retaining them in slavery; nor are such doctrines transmitted to them under the sanction of a religious society composed of the governors of the national church.</P>
    <p></p>
    <p>The perpetual servitude of the Negroes in our colonies is not the act of their masters, nor is it the mere effect of their power over those wretches.</p>
    <p>In every colony the right of the owner is fixed by a law of the colony framed under the king’s instructions, and afterwards transmitted for his approbation in his privy council.</p>
    <p>It is therefore in the discretion of the privy council to repeal all the acts of the colonies, and if that were done every Negro born in the colonies would become entitled to all the privileges and franchises of the natural born subjects of tis realm.</p>
